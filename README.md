This project was created at INRIA Rennes, Bretagne-Atlantique for my thesis at the [Rainbow](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/) team.


This project lets you to simulate a single image as seen by a robotic arm, from different orientations. Values of each image can be mapped to orientation values and can be used for other experiments.
